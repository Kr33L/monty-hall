// Create a list of doors,
const doors = [1, 2, 3];

const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length);
const simulations = 100000;
// Loop through simulations with the following operation:
// Randomly choose a prize door

// Randomly choose the staying door

// Filter through the doors to get Monty's door which is:
// a. not the prize door
// b. not the staying door

// Filter through the doors to get the switched door, which is:
// a. not the staying door
// b. not Monty's door

// Separate variables for win and loss returning true or false on the following conditions:
// a. switchWin = (switched choice = prize)
// b. stayWin = (stay choice = prize)

// Return the wins for both.

// For each result, find the number of times the player won by staying or switching:

// Get the average
// Get the percentage

// Log the results.
